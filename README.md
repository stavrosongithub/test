# Prep

So Hi, thanks for agreeing to this call. I've been looking forward to it, hope we can have fun picking eachothers brains
I'm roughly expecting a good conversation to be about an hour, but if anyone needs to leave or wants to linger and keep chatting for a while longer that's fine. Super casual rules apply.

Same goes for attendance - this isn't a private affair it's just me grabbing a bunch of people I figured it would be fun to talk to about a thing. Everyone is welcome to invite others, although I think I'd still prefer fairly small groups (<8~).

I've got some topics/conversation starters prepared, but seriously this can go wherever. I don't want to steer this conversation so much as prod it occassionally to make it do something interesting.

If this turns out to be fun/productive, I'm going to start hosting these chats on a regular basis. I think I could personally benefit a lot from the format - conversations are a really great medium for keeping my ADHD mind deeply engaged.

## Our timelines
The 1 minute version; we mostly know eachother just clarifying context.

## Topics

- Keen stuff
	- I'd appreciate a better understand of what he's weak on; atm I'm not too clear on his flaws, and without that he seems like the ultimate economics expert and that seems more likely to be fantasy than reality
	- Crypto - a lot of credible people see value in the tech, but everyone agrees the coins are ponzis. What is the smart strategy for speculating in this space? Is anyone selling shovels?
	- Public debt is safe, really? MMT? Capitalism as a non-resource constrained system.
		- Seems to propose both the the health of capitalism under MMT rules, and the urgent need for transition to something that makes sense to a resource-constrained system
	- His climate change perspective - 20~ time horizons on critical shifts in rainfall patterns?
		- I'd love to verify/clarify this

- Your climate change perspectives/timelines?
	- I'm actually really outdated/unread on climate stuff. I learnt the basics, read my fair share of Chris Hedges headlines, assumed we're totally fucked in too many ways to count... and that's kinda it (slight exageration :p). Seemed like question thoroughly answered. Moved on to things less certain, more interesting.
